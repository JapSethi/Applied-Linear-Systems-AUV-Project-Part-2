# Applied-Linear-Systems-AUV-Project-Part-2

**To design a state-feedback control system that can control the H-AUV (Autonomous Underwater Vehicle) depth and longitudinal position** 

#### Objectives Achieved: 

- Analyzed the open-loop and closed-loop stability of any state-space representation.
- Designed optimal linear state-feedback controllers using Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) technique.
- Designed linear output-feedback controllers using a Luenberger Observer state estimator.
- Designed optimal linear state-feedback controllers using Linear Quadratic Integral (LQI) technique.

#### Languages Used:
- Matlab
- Latex
